modular_synthesizer
===================

This is a work in progress. A modular synthesizer based on Pure Data, Teensy (programmed in the Arduino language) an Odroid.

I've uploaded the code mainly for back-up. It is intended to be an open source project, but it's still far from complete. Still, you're free to experiment and develop it.

Create a directory with the name 'abstractions' and place there the patches para_on-off.pd and switch_on-off.pd cause in the main patch [declare -path ./abstractions] is being used.
